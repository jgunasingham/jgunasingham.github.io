     Hi! I’m Jonathan Gunasingham, a high school chemistry teacher in St. Louis County. I have a Bachelor’s of Applied Science and Bachelor’s of Education, both from the University of Toronto. I took a programming course in college, and still find it just fascinating as perplexing as. Since then my web application experience ranges from setting up Google sites for my classes and extracurricular to publishing artist interviews and entertainment reviews using WordPress (www.middleofrow.com, support us on Patreon!). I expect this course to give me a better understanding of the structure and logic involved in web development. With this knowledge I want to create engaging content both for my students and my website (www.middleofrow.com), and so I can be helpful to the programmers on our school’s robotics team. Aside from contributing to the previously mentioned website (www.middleofrow.com) I also love playing guitar, taking concert photos, and playing ultimate Frisbee.
