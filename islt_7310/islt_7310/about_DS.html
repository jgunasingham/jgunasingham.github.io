        <h3><em>Educational and Personal History</em></h3>
        <p> My name is <em>Danielle Schieber</em>. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from the iSchool at University of Missouri. I earned my M.A. in English from Truman State University in 2012. I instructed an introductory course on Writing as Critical Thinking while in graduate school. I received my B.A. from the same university in 2009. <br>I served as a Cryptologic Technician Interpretive in the US Navy. In 2015, I received my A.A. in Arabic from the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. I spent the last four years of my Navy service in Augusta, Georgia. I hope to work either in a public or special library in the near future and have potential plans to pursue a PhD. In my spare time, I crochet, studying languages, and read.</p>
        <p><blockquote>“There is no Frigate like a Book
        <br>To take us Lands away
        <br>Nor any Coursers like a Page
        <br>Of prancing Poetry –
        <br>This Traverse may the poorest take
        <br>Without oppress of Toll –
        <br>How frugal is the Chariot
        <br>That bears a Human soul.”
        <br><strong>― Emily Dickinson</strong></blockquote>
