    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jeff.<br>
        <p>I’m an aspiring UI and UX Designer out of the St. Louis Area. I enjoy finding creative solutions while making interactive experiences both fun and enjoyable.</p>
        <!-- Hello, I'm new to coding and still trying to figure out how to indent correctly. If you seen any mistakes, let me know. Thanks. -->
        <!--Hey Jeff, it's Jon! I think your inents are fine and really like someone else mentioned, it's all about what makes the most intuitive sense to you. Also, what type of writing do you do? Shameless plug, I write for www.middleofrow.com in my spare time. Hope this was helpful!-->
        <p>I’m currently working towards earning my Masters in Information Technology and Design with a certificate in User Experience and Usability at the University of Missouri. With just one year left in my program, I’m working constantly to grow as a designer while I hunt for new job opportunities.</p>
        <p>I was born with an insatiable curiosity, I’m always learning new skills and programs and taking on new tasks. When I’m not designing sites, apps, or packaging, I’m usually either woodworking, painting, or writing.</p>
