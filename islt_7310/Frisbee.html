        <p>Parkway United Ultimate Frisbee: Being a coach in a sport of which I myself am relatively new to may seem like a challenging task, 
        however, I have found that using my experience as a new player has afforded me experience that I can use to relate to players who are 
        new as well. Ultimate Frisbee is a growing sport, but still one that faces many obstacles to garnering attention and interest among 
        younger demographics. As such, finding ways to foster learning and legitimacy, as well as trying to build hype have been my main goals 
        as a coach. This involves player interaction during practice, whether it’s encouragement or advising, but also extends to online 
        interaction, such as through our team group chat. This also includes sending resources through the group chat to give athletes goals 
        and techniques to be thinking of outside of practice time. Additionally, utilizing online resources such as our website and social media to 
        create an online presence and spread word of team activities helps not just bring awareness to the team and sport, but provides a sense of 
        legitimacy to the team’s individual and collective efforts.
