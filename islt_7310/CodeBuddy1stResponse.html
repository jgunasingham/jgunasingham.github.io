    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <!--Apparently I have a error with how I'm using my paragraph and break functions but it runs fine for my url can someone help me debug?-->
    <!--Hello, I had the same problem with my paragraph and apparently I did not need the <p> so I took it out and the error went away. Worth a shot?-->
    <p>Hi! I’m Jonathan Gunasingham, an 8th-year high school chemistry teacher in St. Louis County. I have a Bachelor of Applied Science and a Bachelor of Education, both from the University of Toronto. I am currently pursuing a Master’s of Science in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri-Columbia. After school, I coach a high school robotics team and ultimate frisbee team. </br>I am passionate about creating relevant learning experiences and community for students. I attempt this with the same attitude of Toby Ziegler from The West Wing: <blockquote>“We’re a group. We’re a team...We win <em>together</em>, we lose <em>together</em>. We celebrate and we mourn together. And defeats are softened and victories sweeter because we did them together… You’re my guys and I’m yours, and there’s <strong>nothing</strong> I wouldn’t do for you”.</blockquote> I am excited to see how my graduate classes will enhance my skills in these two areas.</p>
