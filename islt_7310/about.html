        <h3>About Me</h3>
    <!--Apparently I have a error with how I'm using my paragraph and break functions but it runs fine for my url can someone help me debug?-->
        <p>Hi! I’m Jonathan Gunasingham, an 8th-year high school chemistry teacher in St. Louis County.</p>
    
        <h3>Educational Overview</h3>
    
        <p>I have a Bachelor of Applied Science and a Bachelor of Education, both from the University of Toronto. I am 
        currently pursuing a Master’s of Science in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
        </p> 
        <p>After school, I coach a high school robotics team and ultimate frisbee team. You may view my full resume of my 
        educational background and related professional experience <a href="resume.pdf"> here</a>. </p> 
        <p>I am passionate about creating relevant learning experiences and community for students. I attempt this with the 
        same attitude of Toby Ziegler from The West Wing: <blockquote>“We’re a group. We’re a team...We win <em>together</em>, 
        we lose <em>together</em>. We celebrate and we mourn together. And defeats are softened and victories sweeter because 
        we did them together… You’re my guys and I’m yours, and there’s <strong>nothing</strong> I wouldn’t do for you”.
        </blockquote> I am excited to see how my graduate classes will enhance my skills in these two areas.</p>
