        <h2>Philosophy of Education</h2>
    </header>

    <main>
            <strong>H</strong>aving worked for nearly a decade in education, I’ve recognized that while some may have loftier goals 
            regarding administration or academia, my greatest desire will always be focused on what I can directly do for 
            students, both inside the classroom and outside. This includes improving my own pedagogy to make the learning more 
            accessible, meaningful, and long-lasting. My pursuit of a Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design is one way I 
            hope to utilize current available resources to enhance learning outcomes. However, teaching focused solely on 
            learning outcomes may seem like successful practice, but does not necessarily imply best practice.

            <p>When so many students are viewing education as a commodity, as opposed to an experience or a privilege or a 
            gift, we educators have to structure our pedagogy in such a way that we believe will truly contribute to the 
            betterment of all our students. With that as my aim I have structured my education around two principles:</p>

            <p>1) Make learning relevant to student’s lives by highlighting big ideas and real world implications to instill 
            genuine curiosity and appreciation for learning.</p>
        
            <p>2) Structure the environment and experience of learning in order to foster the values and behaviors that will 
            improve the well-being of students and make them positive contributors to society.</p>

        <h3 id="colorChange"><em>I. Relevant Learning</em></h3>

            <p>Middle school teacher Eva Marie Olinski in E. L. Konigsburg’s The View from Saturday mourns her realization 
            that students have stopped asking “Now what?” and instead ask “So what?” In today’s post-modern culture built on 
            instant gratification, I find myself constantly butting heads with similar questions: “Why do I need to know this?”, 
            or even worse, “When will I ever need to use this?” The challenge then becomes to sell my students on the importance 
            of my subject matter. To assume that my own enthusiasm and passion for the content could solely serve as the bridge 
            would be foolish, so I must make sure to meet them half way. I do this by ensuring specific concepts are related back 
            to big ideas in ways that show their constant relevance to everyday life. Whether it’s by discussing questions like 
            “Why Doesn’t Your Butt Fall Through the Chair?”1 or “When You Burn Off That Fat, Where Does It Go?”2, by putting 
            concepts in terms of ideas or questions that students can relate to, they can have a true appreciation for the material 
            they are learning.</p>

        <h3 id="colorChange"><em>II. Positive Community</em></h3>

            <p>In a world that is becoming more and more about the individual, I often come back to a quote by fictional 
            White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler: <blockquote>“We’re a group. We’re a team...We win 
            <em>together</em>, we lose <em>together</em>. We celebrate and we mourn together. And defeats are softened and 
            victories sweeter because we did them together… You’re my guys and I’m yours, and there’s <strong>nothing</strong> 
            I wouldn’t do for you”.</blockquote></p>
        
            <p>One benefit from the advancement of technology is the growing realization that we can always identify ourselves 
            as part of larger communities. If we expect our students to live within that framework, it’s only appropriate that 
            we structure our classrooms to emulate that dynamic. Collaboration is high valued within my class, and activities 
            and discussions are structured so that the contributions of every individual are valued and appreciated. Students 
            are expected to work together, and learn from and teach each other. The ability to work with people of different 
            backgrounds, experiences, and abilities is something I hope all my students can take from my class and use in their 
            future pursuits. Even more so, I hope the appreciation and respect of all people will be an enduring value for all 
            students who will pass through my classroom.</p>
