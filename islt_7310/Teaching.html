        <p>Hazelwood West High School Science Teacher – My time in the Hazelwood School District has been marked by significant growth in 
        my profession, not simply in how I run things in person in my classroom, but also how I lead and teach my colleagues within my building 
        and the district. Through the last four years, I have adjusted my pedagogy and adopted resources that will make content delivery and access 
        more beneficial for my students (such as through Google Classroom, or my personal Google Site). Teaching virtually through the pandemic 
        has also increased the frequency that I utilize online resources for knowledge acquisition and assessment in ways that appropriately match 
        my students learning needs. This has been done in collaboration with both fellow Chemistry teachers and Special School District teachers, in 
        order to meet the diverse needs of each student in each class. These efforts were doubled the summer prior to the 2020 – 2021 school year as 
        our district prepared for virtual learning. A team composed of me and several other teachers from my building developed unit pacing guides 
        containing the activities and sequence for units of chemistry. These learning guides were to be used as resources for teachers across the 
        district throughout the year. Additionally, I am frequently asked to lead building level professional development regarding use of EdPuzzle, 
        as a tool that could be taken advantage of during normal learning conditions and during virtual learning. <br> <br>
